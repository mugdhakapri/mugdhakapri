            <h3>
                Gymnastics is a sport that includes physical exercises requiring balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, dedication and endurance. Gymnastics is thought to have began in ancient Greece about 2500 years ago where it was used in training to keep fit for sporting activities. In the Greek city of Athens, gymnastic tournaments were held, including tumbling, rope climbing, and other similar activities. The gymnasium was the hub of cultural activity.
